Tree  description, maybe  on multiple  lines.
Can include  [[id:c468e9c7-7422-4b17-8ccb-53575f186fe0][links]] to  other trees.
Links are attached to specific [[id:6d6d6689-d9da-418d-9f91-1c8c4428e5af][rows]] in the text
so it is easier to track which part of the
description refers to the [[id:9879fed7-f0a4-44bd-bf56-983279afc622][other]] tree

- when [[id:c468e9c7-7422-4b17-8ccb-53575f186fe0][link]] :: Description lists can be used
  to create annotated links

used in description list it's placed as annotation to the graph node.
