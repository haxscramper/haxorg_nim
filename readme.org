Org-mode is the most reasonable markup language <link to this article>, an
I mean really <link to my article>. But it is really adopted only inside of
emacs. Why? Because <some reasonable explanation>.

Will this project change it? I'm not sure, but it is worth a try at least.
Thanks to unparallel metaprogramming capabilities of nim-lang and support
for multiple backends it is easily possible to make it accessible to
everyone - from low-level C interfaces <link to plain C wrappers> to js
compilation <link to js target>. Thanks to awesome numpy project <link>
seamless python integration is also possible. If you need to write wrappers
for your particular language you can see machine-readable description of C
API <link>. Also you can just run parser and export org-mode AST to various
formats such as <json>, <xml>, <yaml> or even <S-expressions>.

If you are interested on how all of this is possible from single codebase
with minimal effort - here is an article <link to article that I certainly
should write /if/ I manage to get this working>.

Installation is very simple - standalone binary, only <size (everyone cares
about these 1mb nowdays, right?)> in size. Various distributions are
provided, ranging from fully-featured with spellchecker, guile interpreter
built-in <list of other optional elements>, to minimalistic one, with only
converter functionality.
