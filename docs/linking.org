* Creating targets

- ~<<<NAME>>>~ :: Radio target. "Broadcast" ~NAME~ across whole document.
  Any occurence of the word ~NAME~ becomes a link. Useful when you have
  special terms, like API/HTML/PEBCAC and so on, but don't want to manually
  link everything to the glossary.
- ~<<NAME>>~ :: Create simple target
- ~:custom_id:~ :: property of the header - can be linked to
- ~#+name~ :: Named entries can be linked to

* Creating links

- ~[[link]]~ :: Link to /something/. ~link~ inside might have a lot of
  different formats, including user-defined ones. Most common forms are
  (things in angle braces are not part of the syntax) -
  - With specified format, external :: Has explicitly specified link format
    in link prefix.
    - ~https:<...>~ :: Regular HTTPS hyperlink
    - ~file:<...>~ :: Link to an existing file. In this case ~<...>~ can be
      more sophisticated than a regular (relative or absolute) file path.
    - ~id:<...>~ :: Explicitly specify target ID
    - For more examples see [[https://orgmode.org/manual/External-Links.html][external links documentation]]
  - Without specified format, internal ::
    - ~#<custom-id>~ :: Target entry with given ID
    - ~*<heading>~ :: Target heading with given name
    - ~<target>~ :: Target radio target or named entry.
    - ~(<target>)~ :: Target callout in closes source code block
