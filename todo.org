- [ ] Handle single quotes for word end in case of ~peoples'~
- [ ] Implement IDE helpers that would allow to take arbitrary piece of
  org-mode code, reformat it (basically pretty-printer) to particular width
  and paste back.
- [ ] Allow line continuation on single-line commands and headers for
  multiline commands, so I could write

  #+begin_example
    ,#+begin-src c++ --include="some-long-path.hpp" \
      additional arguments to body - still parsed as \
      header

      int main() {
        puts("Actua code");
      }
    ,#+end-src
  #+end_example
