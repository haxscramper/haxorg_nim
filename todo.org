- [ ] Handle single quotes for word end in case of ~peoples'~
- [ ] Parse subtee headers into structured tree instead of flat representation
- [ ] Super/subscript in text ~1.28 x R_{sun}.~
- [ ] Implement IDE helpers that would allow to take arbitrary piece of
  org-mode code, reformat it (basically pretty-printer) to particular width
  and paste back.
- [ ] Allow line continuation on single-line commands and headers for
  multiline commands, so I could write

  #+begin_example
    ,#+begin-src c++ --include="some-long-path.hpp" \
      additional arguments to body - still parsed as \
      header

      int main() {
        puts("Actua code");
      }
    ,#+end-src
  #+end_example

- [ ] Implement some rst source code directives

  - [ ] ~:linenothreshold: 5~
  - [ ] ~:emphasize-lines:~ line numbers (comma separated numbers)
    Emphasize particular lines of the code block.
  - [ ] Analog to ~:pyobject:~ - use tree-sitter to parse target source
    file and retrieve all entries. ~:codeobject:~ syntax can use
    tree-sitter query format.
  - [ ] ~:start-after:~ and ~:end-before:~ for including delimited section
    of the file.
